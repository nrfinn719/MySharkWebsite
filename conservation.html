<h2 id="learnmore">Protecting Sharks</h2>

    <p>Many shark species are endangered due to overfishing, accidental bycatch, and the destruction of their natural habitats. Human activities, such as commercial fishing and coastal development, have pushed several shark populations into steep decline. Without intervention, many species could face extinction within the next few decades.</p>
    <p>Marine protected areas, sustainable fishing regulations, and international conservation laws are crucial steps toward preserving shark populations. These measures help limit overexploitation and provide safe environments for sharks to breed and feed. Equally important is educating the public about the ecological value of sharks and dispelling common myths that portray them as mindless predators.</p>
    <p>People can also contribute to conservation by supporting organizations that conduct research, rescue injured sharks, and advocate for sustainable oceans. By reducing plastic waste, making environmentally conscious seafood choices, and spreading awareness, individuals can help protect these remarkable animals. Ensuring the survival of sharks is essential not only for biodiversity but also for the long-term stability of marine ecosystems.</p>
