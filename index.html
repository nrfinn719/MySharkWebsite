<h2>Introduction to Sharks</h2>
<p>Sharks are some of the oldest living creatures on Earth, having survived multiple mass extinction events over more than 400 million years. Their evolutionary history is remarkably rich, revealing how these animals adapted to diverse marine environments. Over time, sharks have developed highly specialized senses, efficient swimming mechanics, and unique physiological features that allow them to thrive in ecosystems across the globe.</p>
<p>These creatures are often misunderstood. Although many people fear sharks because of how they are portrayed in movies and media, the reality is far more complex. Most species pose no threat to humans and instead help stabilize marine food webs. Their presence keeps prey populations balanced and prevents overgrazing of essential marine flora, indirectly supporting coral reefs and seagrass beds.</p>
<p>The study of sharks helps scientists better understand ocean health, predator-prey dynamics, and the cascading impact of environmental changes. Research on their migratory patterns, reproduction, and sensory systems has contributed to advances in marine biology. Understanding sharks also helps researchers track changes in ocean chemistry, water temperature, and biodiversity—key factors in monitoring the planet’s shifting climate.</p>
